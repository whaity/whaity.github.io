In the old days, there was a port on your firewall, sometimes yellow, that was marked untrusted, and another marked trusted. Anything that was plugged in to the trusted port was trusted.

This was not a new consept. It is basically the same idea behind castles and forts. The walls would protect the defenders of the castle. Your firewall was the walls of the castle. Well you don&rsquo;t need to work long in modern IT to start to see the problems with this.
Firstly, where do you put the firewall. It is fine if you have a single site and all users work from there on controlled computers, but when you start to move the the &lsquo;work anywhere&rsquo;</p>
